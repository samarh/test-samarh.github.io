I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am advised by [Duncan Watts](https://duncanjwatts.com/) and [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). My research interests are at the intersection of computational social science and natural language processing, with a focus on using large language models to study bias in the mainstream media. I aim to understand publishing patterns in the U.S. news landcape, what events newspapers choose to report on, and how they frame their stories. I am part of the [Penn Media Accountability Project](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/project/penn-map/) and one of the lead researchers on the [Media Bias Detector](https://mediabiasdetector.seas.upenn.edu/).

Before coming to Penn, I received my MS in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, where I was a Fulbright Scholar and worked with [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/) and [Nanyun Peng](https://vnpeng.net/) at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://isi.edu/). I received my BSc, also in Computer Science, from the [University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore](https://uet.edu.pk/), and spent a couple of years building natural language processing systems for Urdu, my native language. Some of my work here was featured on [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2017/04/10/why-we-need-to-democratize-ai-machine-learning-education/).

Here is my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/udwil81sw1gf669/CV_Samar_Haider.pdf?raw=1).
